## Data collected from the sensors is visualised by a number of python scripts

The file that we use at the moment is:  AQDataplot.py

I run it in anaconda using the command: python AQDataplot.py

It looks in the current directory for a csv file that matches the information in the Dates array, then plots that data onto a map.  It creates a html file called STATICMAP.
